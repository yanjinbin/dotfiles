# Third-party notices

This project is a fork of [qintmb/herdr-icon-agent-ui](https://github.com/qintmb/herdr-icon-agent-ui)
(MIT). The icon font, the SVG marks and the glyph design are inherited from it; the runtime was
rewritten. See `LICENSE`.

The marks built into the font come from `tools/svg/`, and the same shapes appear beside
each vendor's name in the READMEs from `assets/marks/`. The table below names where a mark
was taken from, or — where it was not taken from a published icon set — who owns the brand
it depicts. Marks identify third-party products and do not imply affiliation or endorsement.

Marks for `cursor`, `opencode`, `hermes`, `copilot`, `deepseek`, `gemini`,
`gpt`, `qwen`, `agy`, `kiro`, and `glm` were taken from [lobehub/lobe-icons](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-icons)
(MIT) and re-normalized to bare `<path>` geometry. The MIT license covers that
project's packaging, not the trademarks of the depicted brands.

## JetBrains Mono

`dist/JetBrainsMonoHerdr-Regular.ttf` is JetBrains Mono v2.304 (© 2020 The JetBrains
Mono Project Authors, SIL Open Font License 1.1) with this project's 30 icon glyphs
patched in and the family renamed to "JetBrains Mono Herdr", as the OFL requires for a
modified build. The OFL text ships alongside it as `dist/OFL.txt`; the font's own
copyright and license name records are kept intact.

`dist/HerdrAgentIconsMax-Regular.ttf` is built from the SVG marks above and contains no
JetBrains Mono outlines; only its vertical metrics (units per em, advance width, ascent
and descent) are copied so the icons sit on the same line as that face.
