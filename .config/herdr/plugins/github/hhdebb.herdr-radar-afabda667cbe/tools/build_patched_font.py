"""Patch our icon glyphs into a full JetBrains Mono, for hosts that take one
font file and no fallback config — a mobile terminal (Moshi) being the case in
point: our icon-only face would leave it with no Latin at all.

Zero rescaling: the icon font's metrics were copied from JetBrains Mono in the
first place (UPM 1000, advance 600, ascent 1020), so glyphs transplant as-is.

The base face is deliberately not in this repository: it is megabytes of
upstream release that every build only reads. Fetch it when you need it, at the
version THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md records:

    curl -fsSLO https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/releases/download/v2.304/JetBrainsMono-2.304.zip
    unzip -j JetBrainsMono-2.304.zip fonts/ttf/JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf

Run this after every icon-font change: the patched face carries a copy of the
glyphs, so it goes stale silently otherwise.

Usage: build_patched_font.py <JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf> [output.ttf]
