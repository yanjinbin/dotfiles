// only expressible as a differently-named token the row paints dim. The value
// is Herdr's own terminal title, republished under a state-coloured name.
// Both resolve to whether the write actually landed. Callers cache "what this
// pane shows" to skip redundant writes, and caching a FAILED write pins the
// pane to a token it never got — a transient socket timeout then reads as a
// permanently wrong (or missing) line until the value happens to change.

// of staying in full brand colour, which is the entry's loudest ink. Only one
// member of each family is ever set, so a row holding a whole family still
// renders a single cell and pays no separator.
// One report may carry at most 16 tokens — the whole patch is rejected past
