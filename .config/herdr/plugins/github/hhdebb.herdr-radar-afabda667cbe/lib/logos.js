// The lifecycle marks live in our own font for the same reason the logos do:
// `✓ ○ ◌` are missing from plenty of monospace faces, and a terminal that falls
// back to a CJK face draws them at full width — a circle sized for a Han
// character sitting next to text that is not. Borrowed Unicode looked fine on
// Windows and oversized on macOS purely by luck of the fallback chain.
// The three idle tiers deliberately share ONE mark. They used to differ in
// shape as well as colour \u2014 filled disc, ring, dot \u2014 because shape survives
// where colour fails. That was written when the sidebar had no ordering and
// the tier was the only way to find a live session among thirty. Sorting by
// activity does that job now, so three shapes for one concept became noise:
// a column of identical marks with a colour gradient reads faster than three
// glyphs the eye must first learn. E1C4/E1C5 stay in the font, unused, so
// this is three lines to revert.
//
// The mark is the RING and not the dot because it shares its row with Herdr's
// cell separator, which is itself a middot \u2014 a dot that means "state" and a
// dot that means "next field" are the same handful of pixels. The ring is
// scaled down in font/codepoints.toml so it still reads as a marker beside
// the title rather than a bullet in front of it.
// `working` takes the same ring as the idle tiers rather than a spinner of
// its own: the motion is the braille frames in front of the title, and two
// things animating inside one entry fight each other. Its ring is painted in
// the brand colour, so the row still says "this one is busy" at a glance.
