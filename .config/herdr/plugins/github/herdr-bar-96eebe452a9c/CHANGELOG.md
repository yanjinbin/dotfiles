# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.5.1

- Auto titles now treat the folder-derived agent name that launchers such as
  herdr-newtab-plus pass to `herdr agent start` as a default, so those tabs
  get task titles too.

## 0.5.0

- Follow Claude and Codex task titles every two seconds, including while the
  popup is closed. Start one watcher through startup and agent-detection hooks.
- Persist ownership of automatic names so later task titles update them while
  manual tab, pane, and agent names remain untouched.
- Keep all naming I/O out of the popup; handle unavailable state storage,
  avoid duplicate idle snapshots, and isolate ownership and locks by server.
- Reconnect after server restarts, check registration through the API, reload
  upgraded watcher code without releasing its lock, and add start/stop actions.
- Give status glyphs more space after vendor logos and color working titles orange.
- Require Herdr 0.9.0 for startup hooks and agent session metadata.

## 0.4.0

- Automatically name default Claude tabs from local session transcripts when
  the bar opens or refreshes. Preserve existing tab, pane and agent names,
  including names set by another plugin. Set `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_TRANSCRIPT=false`
  to opt out; clear a tab's name to let the bar fill it again.
- Refresh the demo with task titles shown once, leading agent logos, and
  documentation for automatic tab naming and icon setup.
- Lead agent rows with Claude, Codex, Pi, Grok, Kimi, Gemini, Cursor and OpenCode
  logos when the Herdr Agent Icons Max font is installed, with colored text
  fallbacks and optional font overrides.

## 0.3.0

- `%` filters to named panes: one row per pane you gave a name with
  `herdr pane rename`, led by that name, and Enter focuses that exact pane.
  Named panes also show up in Everything and its searches; unnamed panes stay
  out of the way. (#5, thanks @silva96)
- The top bar always names the active filter — `everything`, `@ agents`,
  `% panes`, `$ shells`, or `! needs you` — as a highlighted label, instead of
  showing a chip only when a filter is on. A scoped empty state names the
  filter that came up empty rather than saying "this filter". (#4, thanks
  @silva96)
- `ctrl+j` moves the selection down, as documented, instead of confirming the
  row: the decoder read its `0x0A` byte as Enter, so the movement binding
  never fired. Enter itself is unaffected — terminals send `0x0D` for it.
  (#6, thanks @skarakayali-lh)
- The deterministic README demo now shows the `%` panes filter and the
  always-visible filter label, and the README points at
  [herdr-newtab-plus](https://github.com/jeffarese/herdr-newtab-plus) for the
  tab-opening half of the loop.

## 0.2.1

- `"preview": false` now means the preview starts hidden rather than staying
  hidden: `ctrl+o` brings it up for the rest of the run. `ctrl+o` also opens the
  preview in a popup that `"auto"` considers too narrow, so one press always
  flips what is on screen.

## 0.2.0

- `ctrl+r` opens an inline editor for the selected row's tab name. `enter`
  saves through `tab.rename`, `esc` keeps the old name, and failures leave the
  editor open for correction.
- Claude, Codex, Kimi, Gemini, Cursor, and OpenCode labels use distinct,
  configurable colors. Folder or workspace metadata is omitted when the same
  name is already visible in the title or summary.
- The deterministic README demo now shows both the agent colors and the
  `ctrl+r` rename interaction.
- `delete`, and `backspace` once it has nothing left to erase, close the
  selected row's tab after a confirmation in the footer; `enter` or `y` goes
  through with it, `esc` or any other key calls it off. A tab running more than
  one agent says how many go with it. Forward delete in the query moved to
  `ctrl+d`.
- Agent rows lead with the tab's own name and trail it with the agent's current
  summary, dropping the summary when a narrow row has no space for it or when it
  only repeats the name.
- Matches are highlighted wherever the row draws the text they landed in — the
  tab name, the agent's summary, the directory, the agent name, the workspace —
  instead of only in the tab name, which left a row matched entirely on its
  summary with nothing lit up at all.
- Matched characters are underlined as well as colored and bold, so the fuzzy
  subsequence is legible when it lands one letter at a time.
- Secondary text (summaries, agent names, running times) is a readable gray
  chosen from the terminal's background rather than the terminal's dim color,
  which left it near-invisible on a selected row. Separators and rules keep the
  dim color, so the row still reads in tiers. Override with `colors.muted`.
- Rows show how long their process has been running — the agent session, or
  whatever a plain tab is running. Read once per pane from `pane.process_info`
  and `ps`, then ticked locally.

## 0.1.0

Initial release. Requires herdr 0.7.4+ and Python 3.9+.

- Fuzzy bar over agents, agent-less tabs, and workspaces, matched on title,
  working directory, agent name and kind, branch, workspace, and tab number.
- Live status glyphs and colors mirroring herdr's sidebar, refreshed while open.
- Resting order: recents first, then blocked, done, working, idle; the current
  row is never first, so open-then-Enter behaves like alt-tab.
- Preview column tailing the selected pane.
- `@` agents, `$` shells, and `!` needs-you filters, plus tab to cycle them.
- Mouse click and wheel support, bracketed paste, CJK-safe layout.
- Terminal-native colors with optional overrides in `config.json`.
