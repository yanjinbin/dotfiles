"""A deliberately busy synthetic Herdr snapshot, for demos and recordings.

``tests/fixtures.py`` is small on purpose -- it is there to make assertions
readable. This one is the opposite: three workspaces, twenty-odd rows, every
status the bar knows how to draw, and enough agents that the list scrolls and
the spinners never stop. It is what a real afternoon looks like, and it is the
session ``scripts/record_demo.py`` films.

Everything here is invented -- the projects, the branches, the agents and the
pane output. No real repository, host or session is referenced.
