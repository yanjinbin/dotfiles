"""Score how efficiently the bar paints itself.

    python3 scripts/bench.py                 # the score and where it comes from
    python3 scripts/bench.py --scenarios     # per-scenario detail
    python3 scripts/bench.py --json          # machine-readable, for tracking

A terminal UI has two costs, and only one of them is CPU. The other is the
bytes it pushes down the pipe: over ssh, or through a multiplexer, a repaint
that could have been forty bytes and was four kilobytes is felt as lag no
profiler will show you. So the bench drives the real `Bar` against fixture
data through a headless terminal, models the screen the way a terminal would,
and asks of every frame: how many bytes did this actually need?

Five things are scored, weighted by how much each one is felt:

* paint efficiency -- emitted bytes against the bytes a diffing renderer
  would have sent for the same visual change. The single biggest lever.
* frame discipline -- the share of frames that changed anything at all.
  A frame that repaints an identical screen is pure cost.
* input latency -- keystroke to composed frame, p99.
* scale -- the same latency with 200 rows in the list, because scoring runs
  over every item on every keystroke.
* blocking i/o -- calls to Herdr per second on the input thread, each of
  which can stall typing for as long as the server takes to answer.

The paint and frame numbers are deterministic: same code, same score, on any
machine. The latency numbers are wall-clock and will wobble, which is why
--check ignores them by default.
